# PsuedoRandom-2D-Explorable-Worlds

I designed and implemented a 2D tile-based world exploration engine. The worlds generated will consist of a 2D grid of tiles. The software will build a world, which the user will be able to explore by walking around and interacting with objects in that world with an overhead perspective.



TERenderer.java contains rendering-related methods.
TETile.java represents a tile.
Tileset.java has some pre-made tile designs

RandomUtils.java has methods for generating randomness for your world.

Main.java is how your user starts the entire system.
World.java represents your world!
This project makes heavy use of StdDraw, which is a package that has basic graphics rendering capabilities. Additionally, it supports user interaction with keyboard and mouse clicks.
